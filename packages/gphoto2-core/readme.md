> This project is under Alpha version.

A Node.js wrapper for libgphoto2 written in TypeScript. Useful for remote controlling of DSLRs and other digital cameras supported by gphoto2.

## Features

- Camera autodetection,
- Take a picture/movie capture,
- Take a preview,
- Retrieve camera list,
- Select camera,
- Take a liveview from camera and get binary or base64 of each frame, or write it to file,
- Display info about your camera (summary, about, manual).

## Prerequisite

- Node.js: any version supported by nodejs/nan
- NPM: ~7.10.0
- Nan: ~2.8.0
- libgphoto2: ~2.5.x - via `brew install libgphoto2`, `apt-get install libgphoto2-dev` or download and build from `http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/`,
- pkg-config | dpkg (used for dependency checking)
- clang compiler

> Note: This package cannot be used in front-end context (like webpack, browserify, etc...). You have to develop your own web server and expose your API.

## Installation

After installing the dependencies, just install using:

```bash
npm install @tsed/gphoto2-core
```

## Usage

Here an example with TypeScript (works also with pure javascript in Node.js):

```typescript
import Path from "path";
import {CameraList, run} from "@tsed/gphoto2-driver";

run(
  () => {
    const cameraList = new CameraList().load();

    if (cameraList.size) {
      const camera = cameraList.getCamera(0);
      const cameraFile = camera.captureImage();

      cameraFile.save(path.join(__dirname, "capture.jpeg"));
    }
  },
  {logLevel: "debug"}
);
```

## CameraFile

A lot of different API's of this library returns a CameraFile object.

This object does not contain the image, it is just a pointer to the file in camera's RAM.

You have several options to get your image:

1. Use `.save(filename)` of `.saveAsync(filename)` methods, that will save the image to your filesystem.
2. Use `.getDataAndSizeAsync('binary' | 'base64')` method, which returns following object:

```
{
  data: data, // Buffer for binary format and string for base64.
  size: size
}
```

## Examples

Some examples are available in the `packages/examples/src` directory, when you have cloned or downloaded the complete project from github.

Checkout this project then run `yarn run start:camera`.
