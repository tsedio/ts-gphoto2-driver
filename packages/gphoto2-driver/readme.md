A Node.js wrapper for libgphoto2 written in TypeScript. Useful for remote controlling of DSLRs and other digital cameras supported by gphoto2.

## Features

 - Camera autodetection,
 - Take a picture/movie capture,
 - Take a preview,
 - Retrieve camera list,
 - Select camera,
 - Take a liveview from camera and get binary or base64 of each frame, or write it to file,
 - Display info about your camera (summary, about, manual).

## Know issue

This package isn't compatible with Node.js 13 and higher version. `@tsed/gphoto2-driver use` `ref-array-napi` which have a 
bug with some node.js version related [here](https://github.com/node-ffi-napi/ref-napi/issues/47).

The possible solutions would be:

- Find a way not to use ref-array-napi to manipulate C++ Array in Node.js,
- That the author of the module finds a solution to correct the problem,
- Redevelop the driver directly with NAPI.

Obviously any help is welcome to move the project forward :)

## Prerequisite

 - Node.js: 12 or lower
 - NPM: ~7.10.0
 - Nan: ~2.8.0
 - libgphoto2: ~2.5.x - via `brew install libgphoto2`, `apt-get install libgphoto2-dev` or download and build from `http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/`,
 - pkg-config | dpkg (used for dependency checking)
 - clang compiler

> Note: This package cannot be used in front-end context (like webpack, browserify, etc...). You have to develop your own web server and expose your API.

## Installation

After installing the dependencies, just install using:

```bash
brew install libgphoto2
// or
apt-get install libgphoto2-dev

// then
npm install @tsed/gphoto2-driver
```

## Usage

Here an example with TypeScript (works also with pure javascript in Node.js):

```typescript
import Path from "path";
import { CameraList, closeQuietly } from "@tsed/gphoto2-driver";

const cameraList = new CameraList().load();

console.log('Nb camera', cameraList.size);

if (cameraList.size) {
  const camera = cameraList.getCamera(0);
  console.log('Camera =>', camera);

  const cameraFile = camera.captureImage();

  cameraFile.save(path.join(__dirname, 'capture.jpeg'));

  closeQuietly(cameraFile);
  closeQuietly(camera);
}

cameraList.close();
```

## CameraFile

A lot of different API's of this library returns a CameraFile object.

This object does not contain the image, it is just a pointer to the file in camera's RAM.

You have several options to get your image:

1) Use `.save(filename)` of `.saveAsync(filename)` methods, that will save the image to your filesystem.
2) Use `.getDataAndSizeAsync('binary' | 'base64')` method, which returns following object:

```
{
  data: data, // Buffer for binary format and string for base64.
  size: size
}
```

## Examples

Some examples are available in the `packages/examples/src` directory, when you have cloned or downloaded the complete project from github.

Checkout this project then run `npm run install:examples && npm run develop` and run `node examples/camera.ts`.
